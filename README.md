Made a T20I Score Predictor which takes inputs as Current score, Innings (1/2), Scores of both batters, Teams batting and bowling, Venue etc.
The XGBoost Regressor returns the predicted score at the end of the innings.
There might be an issue with these files as they were uploaded via GitLFS.
Make an initial folder, add common.py to it, make the folder "T20 Win Predictor (Updated)" (Do the same for other predictors, add them all in the same initial folder along with common.py) and add these 3 files and then run common.py on terminal.
